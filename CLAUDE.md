# AI Portal — Project Rules for Claude

## Suite Architecture

Five-module suite. Control Plane is substrate; the other four toggle per-org via `module_flags`.

- **Control Plane** (`server/api/src/ai_portal/control_plane/`) — orgs, users, SSO, SCIM, RBAC, API keys, audit, usage, billing, webhooks, settings, module flags
- **Gateway** (`server/api/src/ai_portal/gateway/`) — provider-compatible APIs (OpenAI/Anthropic/Bedrock), routing, failover, rate limits, prompt caching, guardrails, traces
- **RAG Management** (`server/api/src/ai_portal/rag/`, `knowledge_base/`) — KBs, connectors, ingestion, embedders, vector stores, hybrid search, rerank, eval
- **Memories** (`server/api/src/ai_portal/memory/`) — user/conversation/team memories, BYOK encryption (`MEMORY_KEK`), extraction, recall, decay, GDPR cascade
- **Task Workers** (`server/api/src/ai_portal/workers/`) — sandboxed coding agents, git/issue triggers, live streaming, M-of-N approvals, replay

Suite overview spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-28-suite-overview-design.md`.
Per-module specs: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-28-{control-plane,gateway,rag-management,memories,task-workers}-design.md`.

**Operator runbook:** `docs/RUNBOOK.md` — env vars, bootstrap, failure modes, smoke tests, E2E.

`Pivot.md` is the historical phase plan and is **superseded** by the suite-overview spec. Do not extend `Pivot.md`; update specs instead.

### Pivot recovery (May 2026) — known good state

After the 600-commit pivot recovery (phases 1-5):
- Alembic chain green from base to head; `alembic_version` widened to varchar(255) in `041`/`042`
- Backend boots cleanly with `GATEWAY_USE_FAKE_PROVIDER=true` and Fernet `AUDIT_KEK` / `MEMORY_KEK`
- All five module smoke tests pass against a scratch DB (`server/api/tests/smoke/test_*_smoke.py`)
- E2E suite: 6 of 9 specs passing on pivot
- Gateway compat routes require `GATEWAY_USE_FAKE_PROVIDER=true` OR real provider wiring — otherwise raises `no provider configured`

If migrations fail with `type "X" already exists` or `alembic_version too long`, drop and recreate the DB. See `docs/RUNBOOK.md#common-failure-modes`.

## Testing Workflow (Non-Negotiable)

After implementing any feature or fix, the task is NOT done until:

1. E2E Playwright tests are written for the new functionality
2. New tests pass: `pnpm test:e2e:filter <spec-name>`
3. All tests pass: `pnpm test:e2e`
4. If tests fail, keep iterating — do not mark the task complete until all tests are green

**E2E tests MUST ALWAYS run against the E2E database. NEVER the dev database.**

### E2E DB Isolation (CRITICAL — Never Violate)

- Dev backend: port **8000**, DB `ai_portal` on container `local-dev-ai-portal-db` (port 5434)
- E2E backend: port **8001**, DB `ai_portal_e2e` on container `local-e2e-ai-portal-db` (port 5435)

These MUST NEVER mix. Running E2E tests while the dev backend occupies port 8001 corrupts the dev DB.

**Before running any E2E tests:**
1. Ensure dev backend is on port 8000 (check `API_PORT=8000` in `.env`)
2. Start E2E backend: `./scripts/e2e-up.sh` from the repo root (resets E2E DB, runs migrations)
3. Verify: `curl http://localhost:8001/health` — must show `ai_portal_e2e` DB in startup logs

**If multiple uvicorn processes are running on port 8001**, kill them all before running e2e-up.sh:
```bash
wmic process where "commandline like '%uvicorn%' and commandline like '%8001%'" call terminate
```

**After a worktree is deleted**, always delete `.worktree.env` from the repo root — stale worktree ports cause E2E tests to hit the wrong backend.

## E2E Scripts (apps/frontend/)

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pnpm test:e2e` | Run all E2E tests |
| `pnpm test:e2e:filter <pattern>` | Run a subset by grep pattern, e.g. `pnpm test:e2e:filter thinking-block` |
| `pnpm test:e2e:ui` | Open Playwright UI mode |

Playwright config: **2 workers, 0 retries** (workers capped to limit CPU during E2E runs).

## E2E Test Principles

- **All E2E interactions must go through the browser UI** — no direct backend API calls in tests, ever
- No E2E seed endpoints exist on the backend — do not create them; do not call them
- Use `createOrFindConversation(page, name)` and `createOrFindKb(page, name)` helpers from `e2e/support/ui-helpers.ts`
- Tests that need isolation use unique names: `` `E2E Isolated ${Date.now()}` ``
- Tests that can share state use a stable name: `"E2E Shared Conversation"`
- To mock streaming/SSE responses use `page.route()` — intercept at the browser level, never seed via API
- Teardown cleanup (e.g. deleting a created resource) may use API calls in `finally` blocks — only the regular app API, never seed-specific endpoints

## Design v2 (Vortex) Migration

In progress on `design-v2` worktree. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-19-design-v2-vortex-migration.md`. Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-19-design-v2-vortex-migration.md`.

Reference bundles (gitignored, kept in worktree root):
- `.design-bundle-vortex/project/Vortex.html` — 6-screen enterprise portal (chat / kb / memories / models / keys / governance)
- `.design-bundle-landing/project/Auth.html` — split-screen auth (login / register / setup)
- `.design-bundle-landing/project/Landing.html` — landing page

### Styling rules

1. Tailwind utility classes inline (first preference). Tokens via Tailwind v4 `@theme` block in `frontend/src/styles/app.css`.
2. Global design-system classes in `app.css` `@layer components` for patterns reused across screens (`.btn`, `.pill`, `.panel`, `.tbl`, `.kpi`, `.conv-row`, `.chat-grid`, etc.).
3. CSS modules only when a component has unique structural CSS that can't be expressed with utilities + system classes.

Never hardcode hex/oklch outside `app.css`. Never use the `dark` class — use `data-theme="light|dark"` and `data-density="compact|comfortable"` on `<html>`.

### Migration rule

Each migrated screen must keep existing E2E tests green. This is a visual/layout migration, not a behavior change. Selector updates land in the same commit as the component change. Helpers (`createOrFindConversation`, `createOrFindKb`) keep their external signatures.

## Worktree Isolation

When working in a git worktree, each worktree gets its own isolated environment:
- Dedicated Postgres containers (dev DB + E2E DB)
- Unique ports for backend, E2E backend, frontend, E2E frontend
- All config flows through a `.worktree.env` file at the repo root (gitignored)

### Worktree Scripts

```bash
# Set up a new worktree environment (creates DBs, runs migrations + seed)
./scripts/worktree-up.sh <worktree-name>

# Tear down a worktree environment (stops/removes Docker containers, frees ports)
./scripts/worktree-down.sh <worktree-name>
```

### Port Registry

`.worktrees.json` (repo root, gitignored) tracks assigned port ranges:
```json
{
  "main": { "apiPort": 8001, "e2eApiPort": 8011, "frontendPort": 5173, "e2eFrontendPort": 5175, "dbPort": 5434, "e2eDbPort": 5435 },
  "feature-xyz": { "apiPort": 8002, "e2eApiPort": 8012, "frontendPort": 5176, "e2eFrontendPort": 5177, "dbPort": 5436, "e2eDbPort": 5437 }
}
```

### Config Flow

```
.worktrees.json  (registry, gitignored)
     ↓ written by worktree-up.sh
.worktree.env    (per-worktree, gitignored)
     ↓ sourced by e2e-up.sh, uvicorn start, vite start
server/api/config.py         ← DATABASE_URL, API_PORT
apps/frontend/vite.config.ts ← VITE_DEV_API_PROXY_TARGET
playwright.config.ts    ← E2E_API_URL, E2E_BASE_URL
```

`.worktree.env` example:
```
WORKTREE_NAME=feature-xyz
API_PORT=8002
E2E_API_PORT=8012
FRONTEND_PORT=5176
E2E_FRONTEND_PORT=5177
DB_PORT=5436
E2E_DB_PORT=5437
DB_NAME=ai_portal_feature_xyz
E2E_DB_NAME=ai_portal_e2e_feature_xyz
```

Both `worktree-up.sh` and `worktree-down.sh` are **idempotent**:
- `worktree-up.sh`: if DB already exists, skip creation and just re-run migrations
- `worktree-down.sh`: if container not found, skip silently

## Chat Types Stay in Sync (Non-Negotiable)

When you add, rename, or remove any field or kind in:
- `server/api/src/ai_portal/chat/item_kinds.py`
- `server/api/src/ai_portal/chat/items.py`
- `server/api/src/ai_portal/chat/sse.py`
- `server/api/src/ai_portal/catalog/providers/events.py`

You MUST update the matching TypeScript in `apps/frontend/src/lib/chat-types.ts` in the **same commit**.

CI runs `server/api/scripts/check_types_align.py` — the build fails if `ItemKind` literals diverge between Python and TS. No dual-tree drift.

## System Prompt Style (Non-Negotiable)

All system prompts — tool instructions, capability prompts, memory blocks — must be written in **caveman style**:

- Short, direct imperatives. No filler words.
- Tell the model what to DO. Not what it IS ("You are in research mode" → ❌).
- No prose explanations. No "Typical use cases include…".
- Use dashes, not numbered lists, unless strict order matters.
- No hedging. No "where possible", "if applicable", "try to".
- If it can be cut without losing meaning, cut it.

**Bad:**
```
You are in Research mode. Approach this like a rigorous researcher:
1. Break the question into focused sub-questions.
2. Use web_search actively and repeatedly to gather sources for each sub-question.
Prioritise accuracy and coverage over brevity.
```

**Good:**
```
Research mode.
- Break into sub-questions. Search each one.
- Cross-reference. Flag conflicts.
- Cite inline. Accuracy over brevity.
```

## LLM Model & API Knowledge (Non-Negotiable)

My training data has a cutoff and goes stale fast. Model names, tool names, API parameters, and provider capabilities change frequently. **Before any task that involves LLM providers, models, or their APIs**, I must do a web search to verify current state.

### When to look up

**Always look up before:**
- Naming specific model IDs (e.g. "gpt-4o", "gemini-2.5-flash", "claude-sonnet-4-6") — newer versions may exist
- Claiming a feature is available or unavailable on a model (search, thinking, vision, tool use)
- Specifying API parameter names or shapes (e.g. `thinking`, `reasoning_effort`, `google_search_enabled`)
- Asserting which tool type strings are valid (e.g. `web_search_20260209`, `web_search_preview`)
- Referencing LangChain partner library APIs (`langchain-anthropic`, `langchain-google-genai`, `langchain-openai`) — these update independently of LangChain core

### What to search

Use `WebSearch` before answering or implementing. Queries to run:
- `"site:docs.anthropic.com latest claude models"` — official Anthropic model list
- `"site:ai.google.dev gemini models"` — official Gemini model list
- `"site:platform.openai.com latest models"` — official OpenAI model list
- `"langchain-anthropic changelog"` / `"langchain-google-genai changelog"` for API changes

### Rule

If I give model names or API details from memory without a lookup, that answer is **unreliable**. The user should call me out and I should search before continuing.

## Running the App

Always start with `--host` to expose on the local network:
```bash
pnpm dev --host
```
Print the network IP URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.99:5173`) so it can be opened on mobile.
